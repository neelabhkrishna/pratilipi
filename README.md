# pratilipi
So in this assignment I have used ASP.NET MVC as front end and SQL server as backend. 
I haved created a database with named pratilipi whose backup file has been attached in git hub account. In order to to implement this assignment I have created homecontroller and some action like sign up ,login, viewstories etc.
I have created some model classes like logged, Model1, Story , Users. Views are also implemented in it.
